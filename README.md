#### The objective:

1) For this assginment please upload the Notebook you have prepared for a full project walkthrough. Your Jupyter Notebook should include lots of your own comments explaining the steps so you can use it as a resource later. Take a dataset, split it into a training and a test set. Train a Random Forest Classifier and time how long it takes on the test set. Then use PCA to reduce the dimensionality with a variance ration of 95%. Train a new RF classifier on the reduced set and see how long it now takes.
  
2) Dimensionality reduction is a core part of working with large data sets to speed up training but does not necessarily improve the resulting model. Write a clear 2 sided guide to understanding PCA and it's application. It should contain an easy to understand description of what PCA is and examples of when and in what situations it is useful. It should be no more than 2 sides of A4.  
  
#### The final product:  
  
Notebook walkthrough of Geron chapter two and paper on principal component analysis can both be found in the root of this repository.
